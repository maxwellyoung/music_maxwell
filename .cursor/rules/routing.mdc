# Routing Structure

This application uses Next.js 13+ App Router for routing. The routing is file-system based, where each folder in the `src/app` directory represents a route segment.

## Main Routes
- `/`: Home page ([src/app/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/page.tsx))
- `/auth`: Authentication related pages
- `/forum`: Forum related pages
- `/api`: API routes

## Route Conventions
- `page.tsx`: Defines the UI for a route
- `layout.tsx`: Defines shared layouts for a route and its children
- `loading.tsx`: Loading UI for a route
- `error.tsx`: Error UI for a route
- `not-found.tsx`: Not found UI for a route

## API Routes
API routes are defined in the `src/app/api` directory and follow the same file-system based routing pattern. Each route can handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

## Middleware
The [src/middleware.ts](mdc:src/middleware.ts) file handles request processing before they reach the route handlers. It can be used for:
- Authentication
- Request validation
- Redirects
- Response modification
